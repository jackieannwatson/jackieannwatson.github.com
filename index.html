<p>I am a professional designer and animator with a diverse range of experience in developing engaging, digital solutions for broadcast television, motion pictures, websites, mobile applications, social gaming/networking, online educational media, corporate marketing design strategy and brand experiences. I am a Portsmouth, NH native, having lead animation and design teams for projects at Warner Bros., Comedy Central’s hit show “South Park,” The Game Show Network (gsn.com) and Sesame Street. I am a visual problem solver and I am passionate about every aspect of the design process, from brainstorming to launch. I am a team player and I thrive on learning new tools and best practices. For so long I've been at the mercy of a developer to implement my designs and animations. I am so excited about the Startup Institute and diving deep into designing with code!</p>
